### Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the global flight network using a graph-based approach. Users can explore how airports are interconnected through various airlines and discover the most efficient routes between any two airports globally.

### User Interaction
- **Airport Selection**: Users will be prompted to enter IATA codes for source and destination airports.
- **Airline Filter**: Users have the option to filter routes by specific airlines if desired.
- **Analysis Execution**: Upon entering the input, the system computes the shortest path or other requested analysis between the specified airports.

### Program Response
- **Route Information**: The program displays the shortest path between the selected airports along with the number of stops and total travel distance.
- **Airline-Specific Data**: If an airline filter is applied, only routes operated by the selected airline are considered in the analysis.

### Special Instructions - Currently this isn't available due to lack of data and consistency of data (please refer conclusion/summary pdf)
- **API Keys**: If live data fetching is implemented, API keys from data providers (like OpenFlights or OurAirports) may be required.
- **Data Updates**: Users are advised to ensure the dataset is up-to-date for accurate results.


### Required Python Packages
- `requests`: For fetching data from APIs.
- `flask`: To run the web interface allowing user interactions.
- `networkx`: For constructing and analyzing the graph of airports and routes.
- `matplotlib`: For generating visual plots of the routes.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.

### Network Graph Organization
- **Nodes**: Each node represents an airport, identified by its IATA code.
- **Edges**: Each edge represents a flight route between two airports.
- **Edge Weights**: Can be based on factors like flight duration, distance, or cost, depending on the analysis focus.
